/**
 * P1363 7.2.1 ECSVDP-DH
 *
 * ECSVDP-DH is Elliptic Curve Secret Value Derivation Primitive,
 * Diffie-Hellman version. It is based on the work of [DH76], [Mil86],
 * and [Kob87]. This primitive derives a shared secret value from one
 * party's private key and another party's public key, where both have
 * the same set of EC domain parameters. If two parties correctly
 * execute this primitive, they will produce the same output. This
 * primitive can be invoked by a scheme to derive a shared secret key;
 * specifically, it may be used with the schemes ECKAS-DH1 and
 * DL/ECKAS-DH2. It assumes that the input keys are valid (see also
 * Section 7.2.2).
